Unfortunately,since the requirements involved sensitive scopes,and hosted on ghpages/netlify which are not top level private domains(which is what google oauth consent requires) , google sheets api needs explicit verification from google,which would take days.

For now,you can see the basic UI deployed at [here](https://satyr09.github.io/playment_frontend_test) , but no dynamic interaction.

To see the app actually running,you would need to download to your local machine and run locally.

Steps :
- Download and extract zip
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run start`
You would need a proper `.env` file for this purpose.(I am mailing the same to you)
Please place it at the root directory.
